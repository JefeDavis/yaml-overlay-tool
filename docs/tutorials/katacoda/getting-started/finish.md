# Lesson Summary

In this lesson you learned how to use many of Yot's features, and should be on your way to using YAML Overlay Tool for your own purposes.

You were introduced to the following topics:
  - Common overlays
  - File specific overlays
  - Document specific overlays
  - Format markers
    - %v
    - %k
  - Command line usage (CLI)
  - Outputting changes
    - standard out (stdout)
    - CLI output directory
    - outputPath

We'll cover more advanced features in future lessons, such as:
  - Injecting comments alongside existing values
  - Manipulating existing comments
  - Manipulating existing values with format markers and a sed implementation
  - Using Go templating within Yot instructions files
